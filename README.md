# 📦 FINAL PACKAGE - Put These Files in GitHub

## Your GitHub Repo Should Have Exactly This:

```
phoenix-workbench/
  ├── index.html
  ├── vercel.json
  └── api/
      └── messages.js
```

## 📥 What to Download:

All files are in the `FINAL-GITHUB-PACKAGE` folder:

1. **index.html** - The workbench (no API key input needed)
2. **vercel.json** - Vercel configuration  
3. **api/messages.js** - Uses your Anthropic key from environment variable

## 🚀 Steps:

### 1. Delete Everything in Your GitHub Repo
   - Go to your `phoenix-workbench` repo
   - Delete all existing files

### 2. Upload These 3 Files
   - Upload `index.html` to root

   - Create `api` folder and upload `messages.js` inside it

### 3. Make Sure Your Vercel Has the API Key
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Confirm you have: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = `sk-ant-...`

### 4. Vercel Will Auto-Deploy
   - Wait 30 seconds
   - Visit your URL
   - **Just start typing and send a message - no API key needed!**
